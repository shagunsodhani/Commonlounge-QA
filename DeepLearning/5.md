**Question**

How did you end up exploring Deep Learning? And what are the related areas that eventually helped you discover your interest in Machine learning..?

**Answer**

Somewhere around December 2015, I was looking into the problem of time series prediction where you look at the last n values from the time series to predict the next value. Around that time, my friend [Abhishek Das (abhshkdz)](https://twitter.com/abhshkdz) told me about Recurrent Neural Networks which are very effective for sequence prediction. This is how I started exploring Deep Learning. If you look at the [list of papers](https://github.com/shagunsodhani/papers-I-read) I posted online, most papers till that time are related to Big Data and Distributed Systems and not Deep Learning.

I started reading about deep learning, did a couple of courses and thoroughly enjoyed working in this area. So that's how I landed up in this domain.
