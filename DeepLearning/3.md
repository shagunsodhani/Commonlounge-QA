**Question**

What are the good metrics to evaluate qualitative and quantitative​ value of ranked keyphrases?

Also, in case of imbalanced keyphrase dataset, is it good to apply ML modelling​ for ranking? If yes, which all algorithms we can use to improve over unsupervised techniques?

**Answer**

The basic evaluation strategy for keyphrases is to have a gold standard of keyphrases and then do an exact match with the generated keyphrases. Since it is an "exact" match, it would treat "deep neural networks" and "deep neural nets" as different keyphrases even though the two are very similar. These differences can be partially handled using stemmers or by using metrics from machine translation literature (so as to appropriately award the partial matches). This includes metrics like [BLEU](http://acl-arc.comp.nus.edu.sg/archives/acl-arc-090501d4/data/pdf/anthology-PDF/P/P02/P02-1040.pdf), [METEOR](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~alavie/METEOR/), [ROUGE](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W04/W04-1013.pdf) etc.

Alternatively, you may use the word embeddings from [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf) or 
[Word2Vec](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf) and use them to compose embeddings for the keyphrases. These word embeddings can capture the notion of word-similarity. This gives you a vector representation for each keyphrase - both in the gold standard and in the set generate by your system. Now you can define a weighted-sum-of-similarity metric and use that as a proxy to say how similar is your list of ranked keyphrases to the ranked list of the gold standard.

I have not worked with imbalanced keyphrase dataset so take my advice with a pinch of salt. 

* Try to correct the class imbalance, either by collecting more data or by synthetically generating data (oversampling) or by undersampling from the given data. 
* Cost-Sensitive Learning: Use an asymmetric error function where a higher error is incurred for making incorrect predictions wrt minority keyphrases.

Since I am not much familiar with literature on keyphrase extraction, especially the recent advances, the unsupervised approaches may outperform the supervised ones.
